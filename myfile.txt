Mr. Adams memory has led him into unquestionable 
error. At the age of 88 and 47 years after the 
transactions, . . . this is not wonderful.
Nor should I . . . venture to oppose my 
memory to his, were it not supported by 
written notes, taken by myself at the moment 
and on the spot. . . The Committee of 
5 met, no such thing as a sub-committee 
was proposed, but they unanimously pressed 
on myself alone to undertake the draught. I co
nsented; I drew it; but before I reported it
 to the committee I communicated it separately
  to Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams requesting their
   corrections;. . . and you have seen the original paper now in my hands, with the corrections of Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams interlined in their own handwriting. Their alterations were two or three only, and merely verbal. I then wrote a fair copy, reported it to the committee, and from them, unaltered to the Congress.
